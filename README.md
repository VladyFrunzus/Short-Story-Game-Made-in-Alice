The files uploaded are different itterations of the game made during the 2 months of coding. "Escape from Romania Final" is the final version.

The files require Alice 3 to play and to view the code. Due to it being made more than 3 years ago and the files being tossed around 3 different laptops, bugs
or even fatal error might obviously occur.
